In terms of human casualty and property damage, cyclone & storm surge is the dominant hazard in Bangladesh coast. Cyclone warning is considered as the non-structural mitigation measure that can reduce this damage. Bangladesh Meteorological Department (BMD) issues cyclone warning which is largely criticized for its several drawbacks. Under the project "Research on Disaster Prevention/Mitigation against Floods and Storm Surges in Bangladesh", a new Cyclone Classifier Model (CCM) was developed to solve this issues. The Cyclone Classifier Model (CCM) uses simple classification algorithm and is used to generate additional information (location-specific cyclone wind speed, storm surge depth, information on probability of house damage & embankment damage and hazard map) for the present warning system which is considered useful by the local people. All this additional information is generated by simulation of 170 pseudo-cyclones by applying numerical model Delft3D, analytical model DFM, structure model ETABS and embankment model PLAXIS 2D. Hazard maps are generated for each of the pseudo-cyclones by using cyclone wind speed, surge depth and thrust force as hazard indicators. A database is created for CCM by accumulating all the simulation results of pseudo-cyclones. Application of CCM gives location specific information for cyclone wind speed, surge depth, status of house damage, embankment damage and hazard map for the entire coast. Evacuation will be easy if all this information is used with the present cyclone warning issued by BMD.
